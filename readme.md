How to get setup:
1. Install the Arc Welder Chrome extension.
2. Use this place to get the APK: http://www.apkmirror.com/
3. Use this advice to make it a separate Chrome app: http://liliputing.com/2015/04/how-to-run-multiple-android-apps-through-chrome-with-arc-welder.html
4. In Chrome go to the app, right click and "Create Shortcut", right click on the desktop icon and grab the command line properties from there
5. Launch the app manually and login, align the app Window to where you want it, and like a girl so you don't get the info box popping up. 
6. Finally get the code, update the executable and mouse location. Put the pointer in a spot where the "Keep Playing" and "Like Buttons" can both get clicked.
